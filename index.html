                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <strong><em>The theme for the project is 'dark romantic'.</em></strong>

                    <p> It provids an ethereal aesthetic that unifies the black pillar candle as the chosen moving object. 
                        A glass crystal was used as a reflective item, along with a yellow apple to give contrast to colour palette. 
                        To enhance the visuals and help with the composition, a purple succulent was included as well as a bird skull, 
                        and scattered potpourri.</p>

                    <p>For the lighting, I used an LED ring light with a purple hue as the Key Light to create a dark yet romantic 
                        ambience, while a cool lightbulb was used as the Rim Light to add definition to the composition and create a colour 
                        contrast. Since I could not adjust the brightness, I placed the rim light at a distance to stop it from emitting a 
                        harsh light. The third light was purposely not included to create a dark ambience in line with the theme.</p>

                    <p>As for the camera settings, it had a 1/20 shutter speed with an F4.5 aperture. Unfortunately, I was unable to capture 
                        motion blur. The candle flame did not move fast enough, and using a higher shutter speed lowered the framerate 
                        drastically, thus making the video feel choppy.</p>

                    <p>In the post-editing phase, I incorporated a combination of an ethereal song paired with recordings of fire 
                        cracking and chanting to create the dark ambience for the theme. Furthermore, I synced the timing of the lights 
                        with the music.</p>
